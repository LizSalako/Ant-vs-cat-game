# Ants vs Cat Javascript game
This is my first game I ever created using Javascript, HTML, and CSS. This little game was meant for my cats to watch, enjoy and play. This game will be coming up with updates. I'm still in a process of learning to advance this and I will share this if anyone wants to play it or see how I'm improving this.
- New update: bugs fixed when players click play agin button
