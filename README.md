# Cat vs Ants javascript game
Cat vs Ants is a simple game in that the player plays Niko to catch the ants off the countertop using JavaScript. This little game was meant for my cats to watch, enjoy and play. This game will be coming up with updates. I'm still in the process of learning to advance this and I will share this if anyone wants to play it or see how I'm improving this.
- New update: bugs fixed when players click the play again button

# Rules
Use your mouse or cat paw to catch the ants and score 100 or over before they spread to the left on the countertop and become infected with ants.
